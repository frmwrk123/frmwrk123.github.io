<p>
    Welcome on the about page of my personal website. This page is comparable to the README of this website. You can
    find the features and a <a href="#readers-guide">readers guide</a> here. {% if site.categories['site'].size > 0 %}
    Furthermore you will find below all <a href="#blog-posts">blog posts</a> related to the site itself.{% endif %}
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
    Despite being a simple collection of static pages and posts, this website has some features that differentiate it
    from others.
</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled text-justify">
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">No Tracking</span>: You read correct. This website doesn't use any tracker. Zero.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">No Cookies</span>:
        This website doesn't use any cookies. Hence it cannot connect two visits to the same device.
    </li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">(Almost) no javascript</span>:
        This site uses almost no javascript. Javascript is only used to make the menus responsive, to replace the
        Font Awesome span elements with svg elements and to load images on demand to make site loading faster.
    </li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">(Almost) no external requests</span>:
        To protect your privacy as good as possible, the amount of external requests is as low as possible. External
        requests are only used for embedded videos, to load the slim version of jQuery and whenever external media
        is referenced.
    </li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Privacy-friendly CDN</span>:
        The external media is saved in an S3 storage bucket, which resides in Frankfurt/Main and is encrypted on the
        server-side. The media is then distributed by Cloud Front to Europe, the US and Canada. Only HTTPS connections
        are allowed by Cloud Front. No access logs are created as far as it is in my control. Perhaps Amazon creates
        access logs themselves. A custom sub domain named cdn.2martens.de is used to fetch this media.
    </li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Privacy-friendly embedded videos</span>:
        Embedded YouTube videos use the youtube-nocookie.com domain which proclaims that no data is stored about the
        website visitors until they actually click to play the video.
    </li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Uberspace-powered</span>:
        This site is hosted on Uberspace 7. That is the new version of Uberspace hosts which is currently in Public Beta.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="readers-guide">Readers guide</h2>

<p>
    The posts are grouped by categories. These can be found on the main menu. In addition you can find my publications
    under Computer Science. The reports from the G20 special committee in Hamburg can be found under Politics and there
    under G20. The Blog category contains all posts that don't match other categories.
</p>

<p>
    Furthermore I created a page about the
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link /pages/snowden-refugees.html %}">Snowden refugees</a> which lists ways in which
    you can help them.
</p>

<p>
    Don't be surprised about multiple languages. I speak German and English and therefore my posts will be sometimes
    in German and sometimes in English. There is no automatic translation or similar stuff available. If you can't live
    with it, use Google Translator or similar tools. But I can't guarantee that these translations will be correct.
